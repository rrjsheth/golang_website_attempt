# golang_website_attempt

This project was an attempt to learn the front and back end of a website. 
I used HTML/CSS to implement the front end. I used some bootstrap for the layout and buttons.
I learnt basic golang web development from https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/ and tried to develop from
the end of the project. I did so because I wanted to learn how to develop website in golang and also wanted
to improve on what the tutorial had been teaching me.
